## usage

### Fetching a Quote 

Use the `fetchQuote` function to retrieve a real-time token swap quote.

```typescript
import { fetchQuote } from "@orbs-network/liquidity-hub-sdk";

const quoteArgs = {
  fromToken: "0xTokenA", // Address of the input token
  toToken: "0xTokenB", // Address of the output token
  inAmount: "1000000000000000000", // Amount of input token in wei (e.g., 1 token)
  account: "0xYourWalletAddress", // Address of the user
  slippage: "0.5", // Slippage tolerance percentage
  chainId: 1, // network ID (mainnet in this case)
  partner: "partnerName", // Partner name for analytics and tracking
};

const quote = await fetchQuote(quoteArgs);
console.log("Fetched Quote:", quote);
```


### Performing a Swap

Once youâ€™ve obtained a quote, you can execute the swap using the `swap` function.

```typescript
import { swap } from "@orbs-network/liquidity-hub-sdk";

const txHash = await swap(
  quote, // The quote obtained from `fetchQuote`
  "signature", // A valid EIP712 signature of the quote.permitData 
  1 // Chain ID (Ethereum mainnet)
);

console.log("Transaction successful:", tx);
```
